DUNGEONS

- Tarro Forest

The first dungeon in the game, while easy, it is much too grindable, leading to an early lead in the game before the main chapters.
It was also brought to my attention that grass-types against water-types are not a good idea for beginners to learn the game.

-- EXP Gain: 40 -> 35
-- Money (per floor): 5-30 (+10-20) -> 5-25 (+5-15)

-- Increased the number of Wonder Tiles on the first floor.
-- Decreased the amount of teams of 2 spawning
-- Bellsprout does not spawn on lower floors, and spawns less on higher floors.
-- Added Skitty

- Tarro Tree Hallows

Maru being the leader brings this dungeon to be more of an annoyance than a challenge with the theme of grass, so having him level up would be beneficial.
The large lack of space on the lower floors reduced the number of options to battle freely, especially with a large team size.

-- EXP Gain: 25 -> 40

-- Forced Ziggy to have Pickup as his ability
-- Removed Warp Tiles, added Poison Tiles
-- Changed the look of the lower floors
-- Added more tunnels and made them longer
-- Reduced the overall levels of all Pokemon
-- Reduced the number of larger teams spawning on the floor

- Dark Tarro Forest

The dungeon was unnecessarily long, making it chokable and grindable.

-- Floors: 7F -> 6F

-- Oddish spawns less on all floors and now has a chance to learn Tickle instead of Double-Edge
-- Shroomish spawn more on all floors, but not all of them will know Rest
-- Phantump are less dumb and hold an Oran Berry with the Harvest ability
-- Further reduced naturally spawned Gold Tiles

- Darker Tarro Forest

The dungeon was unnecessarily long, making it chokable and grindable.

-- Floors: 8F -> 7F

-- Reduced the overall levels of all Pokemon

- Dreaded Depths

The use of Grimy food as a secondary status weapon was originally unintentional. 
However, it proved worthy as both a secondary challenge and as a way for Rexio to deal with disabled moves.

-- EXP Gain: 40 -> 35

-- Increased the chance of Grimy Food and Leppa Berries. Decreased the chance of Apples and Throwables
-- Increased the minimum levels of some Pokemon from 1 to 3
-- Fixed an issue where enemies wouldn't spawn on the last floor
-- Spread the team number odds to range more throughout floors
-- Highly increased the level for Gloom in the dungeon

- Swamp Line 

This dungeon was a place holder. Things would be better if it weren't.

-- Floors: B3F -> B4F
-- EXP Gain: 100 -> 40

-- All floors now match eachother, and use a different song.
-- Ghost-type spawn much less often, and teams of four no longer spawn
-- Drastically reduced item spawns

- Apple Forest

The dungeon loot is not optimized for worth at all.

-- Greatly decreased the chance of Crunchy Leaves spawned in Vault Rooms
-- Greatly increased the chance of Appletun spawned in Vault Rooms
-- Extended the maximum length of the hallway leading to a vault room
